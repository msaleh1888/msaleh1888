# 👋 Hi, I’m Mahmoud — Full-Stack AI Software Engineer

I design and build **production-style AI systems and internal tools**, focusing on **FastAPI backends, LLM/RAG pipelines, multimodal AI services, and cloud-native deployment**.

I bring **10+ years of professional software and systems engineering experience** from large-scale, safety-critical environments (Valeo, Garrett), and over the past year I’ve been focused full-time on **applied AI and cloud-based ML engineering**.

My work emphasizes **clean architecture, reliability, explainability, and real-world constraints** — not demo-only AI.

## What I Build

### 🧠 Full-Stack AI Systems
- Backend-first platforms using **FastAPI**, PostgreSQL, and async pipelines  
- API-driven web UIs (React / Next.js) for internal tools and analytics  
- Clear separation between data, AI reasoning, and application logic  

### 🤖 LLM & RAG Applications
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines  
- Explainable ranking and recommendation systems  
- LLMs used as **augmentation layers**, not single points of failure  

### 🖼 Multimodal AI Services
- **Vision–Language Model (VLM)** based image reasoning  
- Document analysis with structured outputs and grounded explanations  
- Robust handling of uncertainty and failure modes  

### ☁️ Cloud-Native AI Engineering
- Dockerized services and CI/CD pipelines  
- Azure ML pipelines and serverless APIs  
- Production-style deployment and observability patterns
